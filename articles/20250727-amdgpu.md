# Switching from NVIDIA GPU to AMD GPU

## Introduction

Recently, I've got a chance to try AMD GPU.

I didn't have experience as a user with AMD GPU, but I felt it was very easy to switch.

## How to switch from NVIDIA GPU to AMD GPU?

Here is the steps to migrate from NVIDIA GPU.

(I'm using Debian sid as a daily driver, but the following instructions are also applicable)

* Purge all *nvidia* packages from Debian sid

Not only nvidia-driver, but also need to say good-bye to CUDA related packages.
Anyway, it is important to device neutral state.

* Reboot it!

Ensure without nvidia-driver, it correctly boot with GUI desktop.

Now you can see driver was changed to nouveau module.
You can ensure it with lsmod command.

```console
$ lsmod |grep nou
nouveau              3055616  16
mxm_wmi                12288  1 nouveau
drm_gpuvm              45056  1 nouveau
drm_exec               12288  2 drm_gpuvm,nouveau
gpu_sched              65536  1 nouveau
video                  81920  1 nouveau
i2c_algo_bit           16384  1 nouveau
drm_display_helper    274432  1 nouveau
drm_ttm_helper         16384  2 nouveau
ttm                   106496  2 drm_ttm_helper,nouveau
drm_kms_helper        253952  3 drm_display_helper,drm_ttm_helper,nouveau
drm                   774144  14 gpu_sched,drm_kms_helper,drm_exec,drm_gpuvm,drm_display_helper,drm_ttm_helper,ttm,nouveau
wmi                    28672  4 video,wmi_bmof,mxm_wmi,nouveau
button                 24576  1 nouveau
```

* Install amdgpu related stuff

Install the following packages.

```console
libdrm-amdgpu1 2.4.124-2
xserver-xorg-video-amdgpu 23.0.0-1
mesa-vulkan-drivers 25.0.7-2
mesa-utils 9.0.0-2+b2
firmware-amd-graphics 20250410-2
```

Now ready to switch GPU.

* Shutdown and unplug NVIDIA GPU, then plug AMD GPU

I rarely had the opportunity to replace the GPU and in this time need to change power supply as well, 
it was a bit difficult to do.

* Boot it with AMD GPU!

Then, graphic driver was changed from nouveau to amdgpu as expected.

```console
$ lsmod | grep amd
amd_atl                57344  1
edac_mce_amd           28672  0
kvm_amd               217088  0
kvm                  1396736  1 kvm_amd
ccp                   163840  1 kvm_amd
amdgpu              14450688  33
amdxcp                 12288  1 amdgpu
drm_exec               12288  1 amdgpu
gpu_sched              65536  1 amdgpu
drm_buddy              20480  1 amdgpu
video                  81920  1 amdgpu
i2c_algo_bit           16384  1 amdgpu
drm_suballoc_helper    12288  1 amdgpu
drm_display_helper    274432  1 amdgpu
drm_ttm_helper         16384  2 amdgpu
ttm                   106496  2 amdgpu,drm_ttm_helper
drm_kms_helper        253952  3 drm_display_helper,amdgpu,drm_ttm_helper
drm                   774144  23 gpu_sched,drm_kms_helper,drm_exec,drm_suballoc_helper,drm_display_helper,drm_buddy,amdgpu,drm_ttm_helper,ttm,amdxcp
crc16                  12288  3 bluetooth,amdgpu,ext4
gpio_amdpt             16384  0
gpio_generic           20480  1 gpio_amdpt
```

That's all.

Currently,  I'm using it on linux-image-6.12.38+deb13-amd64 kernel.

It seems that there is more newer release for firmware-amd-graphics, 
but no critical issue is found yet.

## Conclusion

By switching from NVIDIA GPU, there were some disadvantage that
some application does not support AMD GPU yet.

On the positive side, no need to worry about nvidia-driver issues such as 
[#1089513](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1089513)

I just started using AMD GPU, I hope I could help to improve the AMD GPU experience on Debian.
