Today, [fabre.debian.net](https://fabre.debian.net) has moved to [Debian.net Team Infrastructure](https://salsa.debian.org/debian.net-team/)

So far, fabre.debian.net was sponsored by [FOSSHOST](https://fosshost.org/) which provides us a VPS instance since Jan, 2021.
It was located at [OSU Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org/).
It worked pretty well, Thanks FOSSHOST sponsorship since ever!

Now, fabre.debian.net uses the VPS instance which is provided by Debian.net Team Infrastructure.
It is hosted at [HETZNER Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud).

## About fabre.debian.net

fabre.debian.net is a experimental service to demonstrate how to
improve user experience with finding and fixing Debian unstable
related bugs for making "unstable life" comfortable.

Thank Debian.net Team for sponsoring,
