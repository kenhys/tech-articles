I've make a presentation about "How to hack debexpo (mentors.debian.net)" at Tokyo Debian (local meeting) 21, November 2020.

Here is the agenda about presentation.

* What is mentors.debian.net
* How to setup debexpo development environment
* One example to hack debexpo (Showing "In Debian" flag)

The presentation slide is published at [Rabbit Slide Show](https://slide.rabbit-shocker.org/) (Written in Japanese)

* [How to hack debexpo (mentors.debian.net), 2020](https://slide.rabbit-shocker.org/authors/kenhys/tokyodebian-debexpo-20201121/)

I hope that more people involved to hack debexpo!
