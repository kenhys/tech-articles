Today, we are pleased to announce that
[fabre.debian.net](https://fabre.debian.net) is now IPv6 ready.

FOSSHOST provides us already a VPS instance which is located at [OSU Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org/) and then also IPv6 capability to us!

## About fabre.debian.net

fabre.debian.net is a experimental service to demonstrate how to
improve user experience with finding and fixing Debian unstable
related bugs for making "unstable life" comfortable.

Thank FOSSHOST for kindly support.
