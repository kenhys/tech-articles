Today, we are pleased to announce that
[fabre.debian.net](https://fabre.debian.net) has migrated to
[FOSSHOST](https://fosshost.org/)

FOSSHOST provides us a VPS instance which is located at [OSU Open
Source Lab](https://osuosl.org/).  It improves a lack of enough server
resources then service availability especially.

## About fabre.debian.net

fabre.debian.net is a experimental service to demonstrate how to
improve user experience with finding and fixing Debian unstable
related bugs for making "unstable life" comfortable.

Thank FOSSHOST for sponsoring,
